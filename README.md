Jim (Xia’nan) began his PhD in October 2024, under the supervision of Nikolaos Sfakianakis and Mark Chaplain. Originally from China, he earned a BSc in Mathematics from the University of Nottingham Ningbo China and an MSc in Mathematical Biology from the University of St Andrews. His PhD focuses on modeling cancer growth, proliferation, and migration, emphasizing individual-cell simulations that account for spatial relationships and force interactions.
